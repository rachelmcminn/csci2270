//reciation 3 notes


stack based array - if we know the size of the array before handed, we can use this
    int arr[10];
what if we don't know the size? we allocate memory dynamically in run time


heap based array - dynamic memory, stored in the heap
    int *p = new int[10]; //variable p contains memory of the first element
- we use the new keyword
- memory is allocated during run time
- the size of the array can be a variable
- if we are reading values from a file which can have any number of values, our array size has to be changed accordingly
- for such case, we use dynamic memory


int *p = new int[capacity];


resize function

int &capacity //pass by reference
